#### Project Overview

Welcome to **Sim Farm 3D**, a 3D adaptation of the classic 2D farming game we previously developed.
This game includes a fully interactive 3D environment, a dynamic player character, and engaging interactions with NPCs.
Our goal was to combine three key features into a single cohesive experience:

1. **Building a 3D World:**  
   We transitioned the Sim Farm map from 2D to 3D.  
   - **Map Creation:** The map was created using Unity's Terrain Tools. We utilized **TerraTex Lite** for advanced terrain textures.  
   - **Environment Design:** We enriched the world with assets from the **Lowpoly Nature & Village Pack**, providing a detailed and vibrant farm setting. Precise placement of assets was achieved using **ProGrid**.  
   - **Character Animations:** For character animations, we incorporated the **Villager Animations FREE** asset pack.  

2. **Player in a 3D World - Movement Speed Boost:**  
   - The player can move throughout the 3D environment by clicking on the desired location.  
   - Holding the **Shift** key increases the movement speed by 1.5x, allowing for faster navigation across the farm.  

3. **Player in a 3D World - NPC Interaction:**  
   - One of the key characters in the game is the shopkeeper.  
   - When the player approaches the shopkeeper and presses the **E** key, a dialogue window opens, allowing for interactive conversations.
